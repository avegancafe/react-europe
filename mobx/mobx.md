# MobX and MobX-state-tree Notes

- MobX lets you use default mutation methods by wrapping all observable
objects in proxies
- MobX-state-tree declares actions with closures instead of bound
values, so you can freely pass around functions without worrying about 
the context of the method


- Create issue in mobx-state-tree with the types of the
`somehowInverseType` in exercise 4
